The goal of this assignment was to create a website useing HTML and Bootstrap to hold and show certain weather data.
With the index folder holding the code for the landing page including the nav-bar, container, and visualzation box used in all the other pages.
each visualization and the code for them are in the visualizations folder. All images and the css files are in the assets folder, and
the csv and converted to html csv are in the resources folder. The data page is currently incomplete but I plan on completeing in the future.
